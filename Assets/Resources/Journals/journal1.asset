  - June 30th \n Will was worried. He always does this, says he's got it handled
    then when it's most important he forgets. He said he had the rations in his bag,
    and now he's out there by himself, looking for berries.
  - June 30th \n The city, the job, the family. it was all too much, that's why we
    came out here. I wanted to look around, take in the scenery. Will trusted me
    to lead. I did.
  - June 30th \n Firewood. We needed firewood and Wiil said his dad taught him how
    to pick it out. I haven't seen him since.
