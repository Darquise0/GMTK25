  - "July 4th \\n It started with the argument. I don\u2019t remember what it was
    about anymore \u2014 something petty, stupid. But it stuck with me. They stormed
    off into the trees. I didn\u2019t follow right away. Maybe I should\u2019ve."
  - "July 4th \\n They said they were going to collect firewood. They looked calm.
    I stayed behind, tending the fire. I didn\u2019t hear anything strange. Not until
    much later."
  - "Julty 4th \\n We argued for over an hour before they finally left. I remember
    watching them disappear down the slope. I yelled after them, but they didn\u2019t
    respond. It was getting dark."
